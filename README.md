This was a project created for the Hack Our City New Westminster Hackathon 2018. The themes for the Hackathon were 'Planning and Seamless Mobility', 'Congestion Solutions', and 'Safety and Accessibility'. When our group's original idea proved impossible to implement, we started working on this idea during the second (of two) days. This website is a proof of concept for a bike sharing program that would encouradge more people to use bikes, and help ease traffic and congestion, and promote a healthy lifestyle, in our cities. The program would differ from similar programs, such as Mobi, in that the bikes do not need to be returned to a hub, and thus people who don't live near a bike hub can still find and use bikes, perhaps at train stations. 

The website has two parts: the top half will show a map with all individual tracked bikes, clicking on the bikes would give more information such as model, condition, and mens/womens, for bikes near major hubs such as a train station, the bikes will be aggregated into the bottom half of the page (else they would clog the map). The bottom half shows the amount of bikes available (and perhaps the total bikes that were avaiable in the last week or so, if that information is useful).
